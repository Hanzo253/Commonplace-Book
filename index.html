        <p class="font-monospace text-center lh-lg">The life of an inmate is not something people usually daydream about, nor do they want to. People know that prison is somewhere they do not want to be because of how the information in public media has portrayed it, and it is known as an inhumane hellhole that has become the epitome of suffering in the United States and other countries. There are a lot of articles and videos currently that show the experiences of living through incarceration where a person can learn that prison is full of dehumanization and harsh treatment with almost no care for rehabilitation due to the greed for profits. The reason why recidivism is a huge issue for former inmates is because punishment is prioritized more than rehabilitation. After learning about the prison system’s lack of care for the physical and mental health of inmates, my biggest concern is the inhumane treatment towards prisoners. I absolutely believe the environment and lifestyle of a prisoner needs to be reformed to make them more humane because they are contributing to the problems of recidivism, rehabilitation issues, and mental health risks.</p>
        <p class="font-monospace text-center lh-lg">Recidivism is known as a recurring global issue especially in countries such as the United States, China, and India. There are a lot of factors that lead released prisoners back into incarceration because the problems that are creating them are not being fixed. They all start within prison, but they accumulate after imprisonment as well. I believe the main problem causing recidivism is that there is no priority for reforming the inmates because the prison system is set up to torture and punish them. For example, according to “Does Solitary Confinement Make Inmates More Likely to Reoffend?” by Anjali Tsui, Adam Brulotte was charged for burglary and aggravated assault which made him serve a two-year sentence in Maine State Prison. He was sent to solitary confinement and ended up “cutting himself, flooding his cell with toilet water, and pushed feces under his door” which extended his time in isolation. The article mentioned that “Once he was released, Brulotte tried to find a sense of normalcy. He started dating, got a job at a local convenience store but soon ended up back in jail for driving without a license, an assault, and failing to pay court fines.” (Tsui), so even after he got out of prison, he was unable to live normally and got sent back there. Furthermore, Tsui stated that “Like tens of thousands of inmates who spend time in solitary confinement, Brulotte struggled to adjust to life after prison.” which means that this form of punishment has taken his ability to live a peaceful and crime free life. People claim that solitary confinement is basically torture, and I agree because it creates loneliness, depression, and other kinds of mental health risks. Isolation makes a person feel meaningless since they are just inside a room with barely anything to do. It feels like time is just slowly being wasted which can be mind-boggling because time is limited, and no one lives forever. So, when a prisoner is not able to accomplish anything purposeful or enjoy something, they will eventually lose the hope and motivation to live. That is why the punishments needs to be toned down, and rehabilitation methods must be improved and utilized more. Norway prison’s system is a good example of a working system that is designed for rehabilitation. For instance, according to Alex Gray’s article, “This Norwegian prison is the nicest in the world”, Norway has a “continuing care policy, whereby everyone released from prison will have access to services to help them with housing, employment, and healthcare.” I am sure other countries can adopt this policy to reduce their recidivism rates. Norway’s system makes sure that the released prisoners have a steady future which prevents them from returning to criminal acts.</p>
        <p class="font-monospace text-center lh-lg">Rehabilitation issues are correlative with recidivism because when prisoners get released, they are put in a situation where they have to figure out how the modern world works after being disconnected from it for so long. The prison system mostly does nothing for the inmates in terms of stable living in society because it does not help them get a career path in progress. They are unable to get jobs which prevents them from affording a place to live, food, and bills. For instance, in the article, “Programs that reduce recidivism could be casualties in budget fight over prison spending” by Cheyna Roth, Craig Estlick was sent to prison because of home invasion, and he was arrested again shortly after he was free. He said, “I was just gonna go out into the world and hope for the best, And I had a really hard time finding employment and I got into drugs, and I couldn’t afford the drugs so I committed some crimes so I could feed my habit.” (Estlick). This makes me feel that the prison system is not doing enough to help inmates become reformed, and I believe they need to give prisoners more ways to develop skills and pursue careers. If inmates get released with no plan in life, then they will have no choice than to commit crimes in order to survive. Shane Bauer stated in “American Prison” that “prisons became something closer to human warehouses, in which most inmates served their time in idleness, without work or much opportunity for education.” (Bauer, pg.36) The key word in this statement is opportunity which is something that a lot of prisons do not have for prisoners. If inmates are just given some kind of education or opportunity to practice life skills to adjust to society, then they can actually have the ability to do something productive instead of being pressured to committing crimes. Furthermore, it is better for them to get a path in life started because they will be wasting time with the thought of their life going nowhere. As an example, Jimmy Santiago Baca said in his book, “A Place to Stand”, “I forgot about life, forgot about myself, and just let time pass.” (Baca, pg. 126). This is the type of mentality that prison systems need to prevent. In my opinion, inmates being able to receive education and knowledge will give them a good sense of direction for what they want to do after their release from prison.</p>
        <p class="font-monospace text-center lh-lg">Due to the harsh conditions and inhumane inmate treatment within the prisons, it allows mental illnesses to be developed very easily. It is not uncommon for the incarcerated to become mentally unstable within the prison environment since it is usually filled with violence and chaos. When someone does develop a mental illness in there, prisons do not really try to cure them, but instead, they put them in solitary confinement where they can be isolated and neglected. According to “United States: Addressing the Structural Inequalities Underlying A Failing Prison Health System” by Homer Venters, “When a person experiences a mental health crisis, the response in prisons is too often simply to lock them into isolation.” (Venters) Using solitary confinement is definitely the worst possible way to handle an inmate’s mental health issue. It will only increase the severity on the damage towards the minds of the incarcerated which will lead to even worse scenarios such as self-harm, insanity, and especially suicide. Dr.Venters stated that “The leading cause of death in America’s jails is suicide.” (Venters) If prison facilities that are known to have brutal gang murders have suicide as the leading factor for prison deaths, then there is a severe problem in the prison system. I feel that it must be so cruel for inmates in prison because they rather kill themselves than do their time which I think needs to change immediately. Inmates do not need to go through that much suffering to lead them to becoming depressed and suicidal. </p>
        <p class="font-monospace text-center lh-lg">The prison system needs to change because if it does not, the cycle of recidivism will continue. It makes prison feel redundant since the inmates who get released just end up getting arrested again when they are supposed to learn that they should not commit crimes. Furthermore, it wastes the money of taxpayers who pay in order for these prisons to keep running. There is no point in trying to use the same method of punishment as a substitute for rehabilitation if it has proven to not fix these problems. After learning about how Norway is running their prison system which gives inmates a more humane approach, I am hopeful that something similar can be done to other prison systems that are encountering these issues. Inmates are still humans, and they need to be treated with respect and dignity. Otherwise, they may come out worse than when they just got into to prison.</p>
