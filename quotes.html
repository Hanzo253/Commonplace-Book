                        <p class="card-text">Prison was extremely cruel back then, and it was just as bad or worse than slavery in my opinion. When someone was sent to prison at that time and even now, they are treated like their status as a human being has become degraded. Being sent to prison was already bad enough, but the staff treats them poorly as well. Back then, they even tortured the inmates for an unfair reason or for nothing at all. With these conditions inside a prison, then it is no wonder that there are prisoners who become depressed or not reformed.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">When the prison system was being developed, people wanted to make profits out of it more than reforming the inmates. So, it is a system that was created by greed and corruption. They thought of how the prison can get more money instead of how to run a prison properly. The wardens acted more like businessmen than actual wardens, and prisons were running like businesses. Whenever there is greed, there will be corruption since there are people who are willing to abandon their good morals if there is something to gain in their favor. They will take every advantage for the sake of their greed which causes others to suffer whether it be a prisoner or a staff member.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Prison can actually bring out the best in people, but it can bring out the worst as well. After living in a prison environment where freedom is limited or taken, it feels like your life has halted until you get out. During that time, a new purpose or new point of view in life can be found. Prison definitely causes the mind to develop in a way that people do not even know they were capable of doing it. They start to learn things that help build their changed fundamental principles of life, so prison is able to extremely shape a person’s way of thinking for the greater good or bad.</p>

People in general can often regret the past actions they have done when they are reflecting on their life. It makes them want to go back in time to fix it, and they question themselves while frustrated on why they made that decision instead of another. Regret is pretty common, and I believe it definitely goes through the minds of prisoners almost every day.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There is a mindset that prisoners have established in order to live through prison life. Their way of thinking is that they must do what they can or whatever it takes in order to survive until their time of punishment is over. They can do that by many things such as getting a good reputation or respect, joining a prison gang, prove that they are not weak, or not get on anyone’s bad side. Overall, not everyone can adapt to this mindset unfortunately, but I believe it is essential to surviving in prison or else there will be trouble on the way. Most of the time, it is not a choice because it is either one or the other that will be harmed which is why prisoners prioritized in looking after their back more than anyone else’s back.</p>

                        <li class="list-group-item">•	Historian Elizabeth Hinton chronicles how attacks by federal, state, and local government agencies against black activism of the 1960s and 1970s partly gave rise to the punitive policies of policing, surveillance, and harsh sentencing that created mass incarceration: "Built by a consensus of liberals and conservatives who privileged punitive responses to urban problems as a reaction to the civil rights movement, over time, the carceral state and the network of programs it encompassed came to dominate government responses to American inequality. Indeed, crime control may be the domestic policy issue in the late twentieth century where conservative and liberal interests most thoroughly intertwined."
